Ooh~
Just look around and see—
it’s so incredible!
So many smiles in a sea of light
Take one step with me and
you’ll be dazzled,
There’s magic in the air
tonight
The hours ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM
My heart goes BOOM BOOM BOOM
The world is brighter because
you believe in me
Let’s shout it LOUD LOUD LOUD
Our time is RIGHT NOW
We’re on the edge of destiny
For a moment,
I can dream with you
Every miracle we hoped for might
come true
We come together,
reaching out from far and wide,
And suddenly,
you’re here by my side!
When our voices and hearts
unite,
we’re gonna shine bright!
Together, we’re all for one.

The thrill of happiness is all
around us!

Hey!
All that we waited for,
the dream we’re striving
toward,
We’re singing, all for one!
ALL FOR ONE!
Everything’s in motion,
Get up and start
the celebration,
Come see the wonders here beyond
imagination
We’re joining hands for
the world to see (uh-huh)
Feel the love and the energy!
The hours ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM
My heart goes BOOM BOOM BOOM
A dizzy whirlwind of dreams and
reality
Let’s shout it LOUD LOUD LOUD
Our time is RIGHT NOW
We’re here together, finally!
Every moment takes my breath
away;
There’s a feeling here that
words cannot convey,
We hear the rhythm and we rise
to meet the song,
And suddenly,
our hearts beat as one!
Every voice ringing loud and
clear, so glad to be here
Together, we’re all for one.
(Let’s sing! ALL FOR ONE!)
We’ll sing in harmony and
we’ll be happy

upon this endless road, oh, oh
Feel the music in your
passionate soul,
